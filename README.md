# school_shooter_specialist
This is a repository that presents a multi-agent system (MAS) designed to simulate emergency scenarios involving school shootings, with the primary objective of minimizing casualties and identifying effective survival strategies with gama platform.

## How to execute it
To test the code, you must download gama platform 
(the java-based multi-agent systems application) 
if possible version 1.9.3 (you can download it 
at this link https://gama-platform.org/download).

Once downloaded you can test it by downloading the 
models folder and copying the contents 
of the models\school_shooting_specialist.gaml
file into a new gama project.
